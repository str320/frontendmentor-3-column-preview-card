# Frontend Mentor - 3-Column Preview Card Component

üì¶ Overview

This project is a 3-Column Preview Card Component that displays three different types of vehicles ‚Äî Sedans, SUVs, and Luxury cars. Each card highlights the key features of each vehicle type and includes a call-to-action button. The design is responsive and adjusts for smaller screens using media queries.

‚úÖ The Challenge

Create a 3-column layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
Apply distinct background colors to each card to differentiate them.
Implement hover effects for the buttons to enhance user interaction.
Ensure the layout remains visually appealing and functional on smaller screens.

‚úÖ My Process

File Structure and Organization:

The project is structured using a single CSS file with BEM-style class names for clarity and modularity.

HTML Structure:

Each card is structured as a `<article>` element, allowing for clear separation and semantic organization.
Images are included using `<img>` elements with appropriate alt attributes for accessibility.

CSS Styling:

Applied CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain a consistent design.
Used Flexbox for aligning the cards horizontally and vertically.
Implemented hover effects on buttons to provide interactive feedback to the user.

Responsive Design:

Implemented a media query to stack the cards vertically on screens smaller than 795px, maintaining a clean layout.
Adjusted border-radius properties to maintain smooth corners on both desktop and mobile views.
